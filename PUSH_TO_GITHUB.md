# Push to GitHub Instructions

Your code is ready to push to GitHub! Follow these steps:

## Option 1: Create Repo on GitHub Website (Recommended)

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `medrefill_mvp1`
3. Choose public or private
4. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. Click "Create repository"

Then run:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/medrefill_mvp1.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

## Option 2: Using SSH (if you have SSH keys set up)

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/medrefill_mvp1.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## What's Already Done:
✅ Git repository initialized
✅ All files staged and committed
✅ .env file is in .gitignore (won't be committed)
✅ .gitignore properly configured

## Important Notes:
- Your `.env` file with the API key is safely excluded from git
- You may want to create a `.env.example` file for others (already exists)
- All sensitive data is properly ignored

After pushing, remember to add your GEMINI_API_KEY as a secret in GitHub Actions if you plan to use CI/CD.
